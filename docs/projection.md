# Load-point projection

Composition is harness-blind. Projection only places verified content at paths
the harness reads. Canonical native instructions carry the selected role's
compact identity card and mandatory skill ids. Compiled context also embeds
the selected role and personality bodies.

```
agent-compose project <bundle-dir> --layout <name> --scope repo|home --target <dir>
```

## Layout table

Every layout declares load points per delivery mode. Native-skills bundles
place the instructions file plus each selected skill tree. Compiled bundles
place the single compiled context document at the instructions load point.

The layouts are data, not Go: `internal/layouts/layouts.yaml` is the default,
and a file named by `AGENT_COMPOSE_LAYOUTS` replaces it whole, so a deployment
owns its harness set without an agent-compose change. Each entry carries `repo`
and `home` load points, plus `cascade` to make its home paths default host load
points for the COMPOSED.md cascade and skill mounts. The loader decodes strictly
and refuses a path that is absolute or escapes its root
(`teable:coilyco/agent-compose#8199`).

A layout that lacks load points for a bundle's delivery mode fails with a
diagnostic. Layout names and load-point paths never appear in the resolver, the
request, the manifest, or the bundle tree.

## Home scope

`project --scope home` treats the target as a home root and uses each
harness's global load points, for any launch owning the whole home. That covers
containers and the native session home a consumer names through
`AGENT_COMPOSE_RUNTIME_HOME`. Such a launch replaces the host global load point,
so its bundle leads with the operating base instead of inheriting one:
claude `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills`, codex `.codex/AGENTS.md`,
goose `.config/goose/.goosehints`, opencode `.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`,
with `.agents/skills` as the portable global skills directory for all but
claude. Verified 2026-07:

* goose documents the global hints path and the `~/.agents/skills`
  recommendation.
* opencode lists its global rules and skill locations.
* claude and codex global paths are corroborated by their official docs and
  this fleet's live v1 load-point symlinks.

## Upstream conventions (verified 2026-07)

All seven harnesses read Agent Skills (SKILL.md) natively, and
`.agents/skills/` is the portable standard location: goose documents it as
the recommended skills directory (its Skills platform extension is on by
default), and opencode discovers project skills from `.opencode/skills/`,
`.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/`. Compiled delivery gives consumers
one instruction document.

Read at source 2026-09-27: hermes (6e69a89) reads only `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` from
home and project skills after `hermes skills trust`, gptme (f7bb348) reads
`.gptme/skills/`, crush (v0.92.0) reads `~/.config/crush/CRUSH.md`. HolmesGPT and
OpenClaw have no layout yet (teable:coilyco/agent-compose#8377).

Claude Code is the exception on both portable conventions. Its documented
skill locations are `.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` only -
third-party claims of an `.agents/skills/` alias are not corroborated by the
official docs or changelog - and it does not natively read AGENTS.md either.
The documented workaround is a symlink or an `@AGENTS.md` import from
CLAUDE.md. The claude layout therefore keeps `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/skills/`.

Goose combines configured context files. Its layout writes `.goosehints`
beside a repo-owned AGENTS.md. OpenCode reads root AGENTS.md and falls back to
CLAUDE.md only when AGENTS.md is absent.

## Ownership and safety

Projection verifies and reads the bundle before it locks or changes the
target. `.agent-compose/projection.json` records every owned file. Projection
refuses foreign files, replaces only its prior files, removes stale owned
files, and leaves the immutable input bundle untouched. A write or cleanup
failure restores the prior files, modes, and sidecar, so consumers retain the
last known-good projection.

An adapter can project into an empty private home, remove `.agent-compose/`
after the transaction, then validate and wrap the selected load points. See
[staged-home.md](staged-home.md). Agent-compose does not emit that handoff
manifest or receive its authority.

## Auditing loaded roots

`agent-compose skills audit` is read-only. It names each skill that two load
roots both offer and says whether the copies match, so a stale copy beside a
current one does not go unnoticed. The rule in
[skill-catalogues.md](skill-catalogues.md) covers source catalogues before
projection. This covers the directories a session loads from after it.

With no flags it reads the skill directories this registry declares:

* The home layout under the real home, taken from the account database because
  `$HOME` is the session home inside a native shadow.
* The home layout under `$HOME`, when that differs from the real home.
* The repo layout at the working directory and at every ancestor.

`--root <dir>` is repeatable and replaces discovery. A directory reached twice,
by path or by symlink, is read once, and an absent candidate is counted, not
listed. Names held by two or more roots are hashed with the catalogue rule's
digest, so CRLF against LF matches and a symlinked skill compares by target.

* **divergent** - content differs, exit 1. Each copy prints its path, `SKILL.md`
  size and mtime, and a short digest, with the earlier one marked `older`. That
  mark comes from mtime and does not say which copy a harness prefers.
* **unverified** - a copy could not be hashed, such as a skill holding a
  symlink. The reason prints and the run still exits 0.
* **identical** - one line per name.

It does not compare a root to the roster source of record, which needs the
compose-added frontmatter accounted for.
