# agent-compose features

Inventory of what ships today.

## The roster is mounted, not embedded

The binary carries no roster. It resolves one from `AGENT_COMPOSE_ROSTER`, then `~/.agent-compose/roster`,
then the seed a package manager installed beside it, and names every path it tried when none resolves. brew
and scoop install that seed, so a roster change needs no rebuild and an upgrade never overwrites an edited
roster in the state directory (#336). The release also ships the composed bundle set, addressed
`<role>-<tier>-<delivery>`, because housecast composes at build time and never runs on a user's machine
(#412). A root marked as an [overlay](roster-composition.md) adds to the roster under it, its `acts.yaml`
appends estate acts, and a role can `derives:` a parent, declaring only its deltas.

## Composition moved to housecast

The roster language, the composition engine, and the eval board runner live in
`coilyco-flight-deck/housecast` as of #337. This repository consumes housecast
from its source repository through `[tool.uv.sources]`, pinned by tag, and keeps `checks/`
to prove the Go engine still composes identical bundles until #339 deletes it.

Where composition lives is a public boundary, which is why it is recorded here
rather than only in the issue.

## Composition engine

* `agent-compose compose` turns a KDL request into an immutable bundle.
* `roster:core` describes 13 seats and 11 personalities, three [archived](role-selection.md)
  on 2026-09-15: refused by the resolver, keeping their charter, art and edges. Each seat
  melds two traits, and every boundary reaches all ten, exactly one as owner.
  [Role briefings](role-briefings.md) own each charter.
* [External person packages](person-packages.md) and
  [local personality libraries](personality.md) replace the default. Their
  manifests and fragments are authored as YAML or KDL, and a package may hold
  both while it converts (#335).
* `personality-library "roster:core"` lets an external package bind the
  [embedded core personalities](personality.md) by slug instead of vendoring
  their bodies. Roles, seats, and identity stay package-exclusive.
* `.agents/roles.kdl` owns [skill-provider repos](role-selection.md), skills, and [repository policy](repository-plan.md).
* [Three model tiers](harness-vendoring.md) declare Core role deployment
  compatibility without changing selected context.
* Materialization promotes admitted `COMPOSED.md` to native `SKILL.md`.
* Resolver traces provider and content outcomes with budgets.
* `boundary-omit` drops a defer-side boundary whose owning seat the deployment does not have, and refuses a scoped grant. See [boundary omission](roster-composition.md).
* Atomic materialization verifies staged and reused bundles.
* Canonical skills use identity cards and compiled fallback. Role bodies cap at
  1200 words, [role boundaries](role-boundaries.md) at 200 words per side.
* [Role adjacency](role-boundaries.md) names each role's two likeliest absorptions.
* [Attribute acts](kdl-contracts.md) give every role, personality, and
  boundary side three named things to run. The identity card renders them, and
  a boundary's acts follow the side the seat holds rather than the owner's.

## Load-point projection

* `agent-compose project` places verified bundles at repo or container-home load
  points from a [layout table](projection.md) `AGENT_COMPOSE_LAYOUTS` replaces.
* Sidecar ownership protects foreign files and restores prior owned state.

## Launch-time refresh

* [Launch](native-role-launch.md) adds color, an Enter gate, and a Codex intro.
* A Claude launch passes [identity flags](claude-launch-identity.md), not files, and exports seat-labelled token metrics. Every native harness narrows MCP servers to the role. A failed [startup step](launch.md) degrades a launch if it shapes behavior and refuses it if it bounds reach.
* Refresh uses validated fallback unless `external-only` forbids it.
* `launch` starts a [second seat from inside a session](native-role-launch.md),
  one hop deep and never over the caller's own load points.

## Inspection

* `config validate` strictly checks staged host configuration without writes.
* `agent-compose describe` renders a collapsible decision tree. `--why`
  follows one item from consideration to outcome.
* `agent-compose diff` reports semantic changes. `verify` checks entry points,
  delivery, traces, and selected identities.
* [Catalogues and export](skill-catalogues.md) provide inspection,
  reproducible archives, and logical content diff.
* `compose` renders the role metadata and the identity texture. `--explain`
  adds the briefing, the credits, the expressions, and the decisions.
* [Evaluation](evaluation.md) derives the board from the roster, runs it with
  `evalkit`, and grades it by hand with `housecast grade`. No mechanical
  scorer anywhere in the loop.
* [V2 migration](release.md) maps v1 roles without aliases.
* TTY colors use canonical identity and pass an OKLab legibility gate.
  Redirects and `NO_COLOR` stay plain.

## Identity surfaces

* [Identity primitives](identity.md) give every personality a `species`, a
  `color_word`, an emblem name list, a `motif`, a `geometry`, and a prose
  `body`. A seat's creature is derived from its meld rather than
  authored, so two seats sharing a personality share an animal.
* [Identity renderers](statusline.md) cover the palette, overlays, the
  `acompose statusline` row, `--subagent` rows, and the
  [short id](whoami.md). [`whoami`](whoami.md) prints it. The
  [overlay](overlay.md) carries a separation-solved window `background` beside
  the accent, so a renderer no longer tints its own.
* [`native-ui`](claude-native-ui-surfaces.md) emits per-role Claude Code themes.

## Roster artifact and cascade

* `agent-compose roster --out <dir>` renders lazy-loaded role and personality
  skills plus [native adaptation](native-adaptation.md).
* Bare convergence emits deterministic [`person.json`](person-contract.md).
* `cascade` emits harness doctrine and the role/residency
  `repository-plan.yaml` with sealed provenance.
* `bundle materialize` returns a verified role/harness bundle with provenance.
* Bare `acompose` converges hosts. `--reapply` forces the layout, `--verbose`
  traces `source => destination`, `-- <command>` refreshes then execs, and Ward
  smoke proves idempotence.
* [`appendix`](cascade.md) composes inline or file tail blocks, optionally scoped to named roles.
* [`source_delivery`](cascade.md) emits a source as an `@path` import rather than inlining it, so a source the repository cascade also delivers is loaded once; a missing target fails convergence rather than shipping a pointer to nothing. A host file needs only `operating_context`, because [absent keys default from the host](cascade.md).
* [Local skill catalogues](skill-catalogues.md) consume AOS roots, each addressed by a forge-qualified source that travels with the root, so a bare owner/repo real on two forges fails rather than picking one, and one name meaning two different skills stops the converge naming both. An entry marked private keeps its content and loses its identity, so a private focus reaches a public lane without the image learning it exists. An [org grant](skill-selectors.md) admits a whole owner from the compiled set, open to repositories added later and bounded only by its selectors, and `skill_requests` reaches one skill by address, failing the converge by name when it resolves to nothing.
* [Release](release.md) publishes unreleased deltas under a hold, with roll-forward recovery.
* A bundle carries a [voice profile](manifest-schema.md) merging a skill's rules with the seat's avoid banks, so a Refuse reaches a checker.
