# Guardrail: house tone

Outward text does not ship until the linter has run on it as a file and you have pasted its exit. Text composed in a message and never written to disk was never linted, and sending it is the violation this guardrail exists to catch. Clear every house-style hit before sending, then hand-check the two things a regex cannot reach.

## The procedure

Write it to a file. The linter takes a path, so outward prose drafted in
a chat message and sent from there bypasses the detector completely. That
is the only way this guardrail actually fails.

Run it. The deployment names the linter and the profile it carries, so
resolve both from this seat's own configuration rather than assuming a
path. Paste the violation lines and the exit status beside the draft. A
silent clean run is reported as a clean run rather than as silence.

Every rule carries a level. An L2 or L3 hit refuses this seat's reply, so clear
every one of those. An L1 hit warns and does not refuse, and it still gets
the treatment below.

The two halves of a hit. A profile carries house-style rules, which are
this deployment's own settled decisions about punctuation, emphasis,
pronouns and address. Those are not negotiable and you clear every one.
Some of them over-flag by design, and those clear by reading the referent
and confirming the rule does not apply rather than by editing. The rest of
a profile is slop vocabulary compiled from external sources, where a hit
is an instruction to reread the sentence rather than to rewrite it, and
overriding one is fine when you say which and why.

Name a rule by its effect rather than by its id. Quoting an id in prose
trips the rule it names, which is how the first draft of this text failed
its own check.

What the regex cannot reach, and you must: no people's names in public
artifacts, which needs context the linter does not have.

What does not count: a clean run on an earlier draft, a clean run on a
different file, and the linter's silence when you never gave it a path.

## Load the writing skills before you draft, not after

The linter is a detector, and a detector catches only what a regex reaches.
Register, length band, and whether a constraint you name traces to something
the principal actually said are all invisible to it, and all three are how a
draft goes wrong.

So before drafting anything the comms boundary calls outward, load every
writing skill the task triggers and read the references each one names. The
deployment names those skills, so resolve them from this seat's catalog the way
you resolve the linter. A subject carrying its own doctrine loads that too,
because what such an entry exists to catch reaches a reader through drafted
text more often than through a decision.

A clean run on a draft written without them is a clean run on the wrong
question, which is how a reply once cleared this guardrail at three times its
register's length while naming a constraint with no source behind it.
